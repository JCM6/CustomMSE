#Triggered abilities:
#A triggered ability can be identified by the words "when," "whenever," or "at", 
# which will usually be found at the start of the ability. 
# The phrase that contains one of those words lists the conditions (the trigger event or trigger state) where the ability will trigger. 
# When it does, the ability goes on the stack (unless it's a mana ability), and responses can be played.
